# Transience_Databricks_LightGBMClassifier
The following notebook is designed to detemine if new info sec assets will have a life-span greater than 3-days using a Light GBM binary classifier. Using Pyspark, the notebook ingests curated data from Azure Data Lake and builds features to censure the data model. ML pipelines are used to vectorized and one-hot encode 10 categorical variables, then over 40 additional numeric variables are added to create a final data model. The data model is randomly sampled into 70/30 training and test data sets and a Light GBM is used to create a classifier with the training data. The training and test data is evaluated with area under the precision/recall curve and model stats are preserved using ML Flow. Final predictions on new data are written back to Azure Data Lake.  Please forgive the multiple spelling and grammar errors you will undoubtedly find. Notebook Cmd's have commented code along with markdown to help the reader undestand the details of the processing.
